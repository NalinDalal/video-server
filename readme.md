6. HTTP Server Project - done, just neeed to check how can i serve the video

- **Project:** Create an HTTP server for hosting and sharing MP4 files.
- **Resources:** ![MDN](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTTP/Overview)

well it's done, just check how to serve videos from a folder

the service starts a be, which i can upload the videos via frontend, they even
get saved to backend as a file itself, now need to serve them here on fe
note in memory, but they get saved, so even if the sites goes down, they still
are there

they literally are there, we need to check for correct video type
but we are only allowing the .mp4 files

the thing is that the video just won't stream, also the fe is written too bad
